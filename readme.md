# Seattle Airbnb Data Analysis

Do you want to be an Airbnb host in Seattle and just wondering where to start? Here I'm analyzing data gathered by Airbnb to answer your question. In this analysis I went over the data gathered by Airbnb to see 1) which neighborhood has the highest number of super hosts, 2) which neighborhood has the highest rental price and 3) how many places are available per home type.

## 1) Which neighborhood has the highest number of super hosts? :

How does the answer of this question impact the prospective hosts? To me as a guest, it is important to rent a place from a person who is certified as a super host. And because I know they are more experienced, I can trust them more. On the other hand, if one neighborhood has a lot of super hosts it would be hard for guests to choose one of the places. That's why for a prospective host choosing a right place to start off their business is one of the most important investments.

## 2) Which neighborhood has the highest average price? :

The answer of this question helps hosts to manage their pricing. In each neighborhood the price is different. The hosts should know about the neighbors' prices so they can compete in the market. Putting lower than others might not be fair to the neighbors revenues and by setting higher prices the hosts could lose the guests to other hosts.

## 3) How many places are available per home type? :

In this question I will help hosts to choose the home type that they think might be profitable for them. For example, if studios are less in a town, the hosts can prepare and rent their places in studio format. If one city doesn't have that much houses the hosts can choose a property which is a house.

Finally, answers to these three questions helps hosts to start off their business in the online renting market. It should not be limited to these interpretations. There are a lot factors that affects the business in the market and should not be underestimated. But for these three questions prospective hosts will have an idea where to start. They also will find out if the neighborhood is good for renting, is their prices fair and is their home type suitable for guests.# Airbnb-Data-Analysis
